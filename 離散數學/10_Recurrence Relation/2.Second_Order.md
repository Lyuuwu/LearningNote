# Second-Order Linear Homogeneous Recurrence Relation

## Worm up

Let $S = \{ 1, 2, 3, ..., n \}$.
Define $a_n$ as the number of the subsets of $S$ that contain no consecutive integers.
Find the unique solution of $a_n$

### Solution

Let $A$ be any subsets of $S$ that contains no consecutive integers. TO find the unique solution for $a_n$, consider the following possibilities:

1. If $n \in A$, then $(n-1) \notin A$, and the subset $A - \{ n \}$ will be counted in $a_{n-2}$ because removing $n$ from $A$ ensures that there are no consecutive integers in the subset.
2. If $n \notin A$, then the subset $A$ will be counted in $a_{n-1}$ because $n$ can be added to any subset $A$ that contains no consecutive integers to form a valid subset of $S$.

Therefore, the unique solution for $a_n$ is given by the recurrence relation :
$$ a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$$

Let $k \in \mathcal{Z}^+$ and $C_0, C_1, C_2, ..., C_k$ is a real number sequence.
If $a_n$, for $n \geq 0$, is a discrete function, then:
$$C_0a_n + C_1a_{n-1} + C_2a_{n-2} + ... + C_ka_{n-k} = f(n)$$

## Homogeneous

If $C_0a_n + C_1a_{n-1} + C_2a_{n-2} + ... + C_ka_{n-k} = 0$, it is called **homogeneous**; otherwise, it is called **nonhomogeneous**.

## Characteristic Equation

Substituting $a_n = cr^n$ into $C_0a_n + C_1a_{n-1} + C_2a_{n-2}$, we obtain:
$$C_0cr^n + C_1cr^{n-1} + C_2cr^{n-2} = 0$$

With $c, r \neq 0$, it becomes $C_0r^2 + C_1r + C_2 = 0$. The quadratic equation of this function is called **characteristic equation**.

Regardless of whether the roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ are distinct real numbers, identical real numbers, or a complex conjugate pair, they are referred as **characteristic roots** of the recurrence relation.

## Solution for Distinct Real Roots

Solve the recurrence relation $a_n + a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2} = 0$, where $n \geq 2$ and $a_0 = -1, \space a_1 = 8$.

If $a_n = cr^n$, we obtain $cr^n + cr^{n-1} - 6cr^{n-2} = 0$ from which the characteristic equation $r^2 + r - 6 = 0$ follow:
$$ 0 = r^2 + r - 6 = (r+3)(r-2) \Rightarrow r = 2, \space -3$$

Since we have two distinct roots, $a_n = (2)^n$ and $a_n = (-3)^n$ are both solutions of this sequence.
They are **linearly independent** solution because one is not a multiple of the other; that is, there is no real constant $k$ such that $(-3)^n = k(2)^n$ for *all* $n \in \mathcal{N}^+$. And by the **first superposition principle**, we write $a_n = c_1(2)^n + c_2(-3)^n$.
With $a_0 = -1$ and $a_1 = 8$, $c_1$ and $c_2$ are determined as follows:
$$\begin{aligned}
-1 &= a_0 &&= c_1(2)^0 + c_2(-3)^0 &&= c_1 + c_2 \\
8 &= a_1 &&= c_1(2)^1 + c_2(-3)^1 &&= 2c_2 - 3c_2
\end{aligned}$$

Solving this system of equations, one find $c_1 = 1, c_2 = -2$. Therefore, $a_n = 2^n - 2(-3)^n, \space n \geq 0$, is the unique solution of the given recurrence relation.
