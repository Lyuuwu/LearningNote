# Second-Order Linear Homogeneous Recurrence Relation

Let $k \in \mathcal{Z}^+$ and $C_0, C_1, C_2, ..., C_k$ is a real number sequence.
If $a_n$, for $n \geq 0$, is a discrete function, then:
$$C_0a_n + C_1a_{n-1} + C_2a_{n-2} + ... + C_ka_{n-k} = f(n)$$

## Homogeneous

If $C_0a_n + C_1a_{n-1} + C_2a_{n-2} + ... + C_ka_{n-k} = 0$, it is called **homogeneous**; otherwise, it is called **nonhomogeneous**.

## Characteristic Equation

Substituting $a_n = cr^n$ into $C_0a_n + C_1a_{n-1} + C_2a_{n-2}$, we obtain:
$$C_0cr^n + C_1cr^{n-1} + C_2cr^{n-2} = 0$$

With $c, r \neq 0$, it becomes $C_0r^2 + C_1r + C_2 = 0$. The quadratic equation of this function is called **characteristic equation**.

Regardless of whether the roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ are distinct real numbers, identical real numbers, or a complex conjugate pair, they are referred as **characteristic roots** of the recurrence relation.
