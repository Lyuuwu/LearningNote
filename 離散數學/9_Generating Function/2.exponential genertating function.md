# Exponential Generating Function

## Definiion of exponential generating function

For a real number sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, ...$
$$f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2\frac{x^2}{2!} + a_3\frac{x^3}{3!} + ... = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}a_i\frac{x^i}{i!}$$
is called the **exponential generating function** for the given sequence.

### Example

Examining the Maclaurin series expansion for $e^x$, we find
$$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + ... = \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^i}{i!}$$
Therefore, $e^x$ is the exponential generating function for the sequence $1, 1, 1, ...$, and is the ordinary generating function for the sequence $1, 1, 1/2!, 1/3!, ....$

#### Arranging 4 Letters in ENGINE

The word ENGINE consists of 2 'E's, 2 'N's, 1 'I', and 1 'G'.

To find the number of ways to arrange four letters from ENGINE, we use an exponential generating function. For each 'E' and 'N', we employ the term $[1 + x + (x^2/2!)]$ to account for the possible arrangements (0, 1, or 2 occurrences). For 'G' and 'I', the term used is $(1+x)$.

The exponential generating function is given by:
$$
f(x) = [1 + x + (x^2/2!)]^2 (1+x)^2
$$

The desired answer is the coefficient of $x^4/4!$ in $f(x)$.

Breaking down the expansion of $f(x)$, we find two significant contributions to $x^4/4!$:

1. From the product $(x^2/2!)(x^2/2!)(1)(1)$, we obtain $4!/(2!2!)$. The coefficient is $4!/(2!2!) = 6$.
2. From the product $(x^2/2!)(1)(x)(x)$, we get $4!/2!$. There are $\binom{2}{1}\binom{3}{2}$ ways to arrange this product. Therefore, the coefficient is $6(4!/2!) = 72$.
3. The product $(x)(x)(x)(x)$ contributes $4!$ to the coefficient.

The total coefficient for $x^4/4!$ in the expansion of $f(x)$ is $6 + 72 + 24 = 102$. Hence, there are 102 ways to arrange four letters from ENGINE.

## Maclaurin series expansions of $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$

$e^x = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + ...$  
$e^{-x} = 1 - x + \frac{x^2}{2!} - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - ...$  
Adding these series together, we find that
$$e^x + e^{-x} = 2(1 + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + ...)$$
or
$$\frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2} = (1 + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} + ...)$$
