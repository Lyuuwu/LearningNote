## Useful Formula

1. Sum of Geometric Series
2. Sum of Infinite Geometric Series

### Sum of Geometric Series

Consider the geometric series defined by:
$$S = \{ 1, x, x^2, x^4, x^5, ..., x^n \}$$

The common ratio is $x$

The sum of this series can be calculated using the formula:
$$S = \dfrac{a_0(1 - r^n)}{1-r}$$
where:

- $a_0$ is the first term of the series, which in this case is 1.
- $r$ is the common ratio, which is $x$ in this case
- $n$ is the length of this series, which is $n+1$ in this case.

Substituting $a_0 = 1$, $r=x$, $n=n+1$ into the formula, we get:
$$\dfrac{1-x^{n+1}}{1-x}$$

### Sum of Infinite Geometric Series

Consider the infinite geometric series defined by:
$$S = \{ 1, x, x^2, x^4, x^5, ... \}$$
where $|x| <1$ (ensuring convergence of the series)

Using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, we have:
$$S = \dfrac{a}{1-r}$$

where :

- $a$ is the first term of the series, which in this case is 1.
- $r$ is the common ratio, which is $x$ in our case.

Substituting $a=1$ and $r=x$ into the formula, we get:
$$S=\dfrac{1}{1-x}$$

## Example 1

Find the generating function for the number of partitions of the non-negative integer $n$ into summand where

### (a) each summand must appear an even number of times

$$\begin{aligned}f(x) &= \Pi_{i=1}^{\infty} (1 + x^{2i} + x^{4i} + x^{6i} + ...)\\
&= \Pi_{i=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{1}{1-x^{2i}} \end{aligned}$$

### (b) each summand must be even

$$\begin{aligned}f(x) &= \Pi_{i=1}^{\infty} (1 + x^{2i} + x^{4i} + x^{6i} + ...)\\
&= \Pi_{i=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{1}{1-x^{2i}} \end{aligned}$$

## Example 2

What is the generating function for the number of partitions of $n \in \bold{N}$ into summand that

### (a) cannot occur more than five times

$$\begin{aligned} f(x) &= \Pi_{i=1}^{\infty}(1 + x^i + x^{2i} + x^{3i} + x^{4i} + x^{5i}) \\
&= \Pi_{i=1}^{\infty}\dfrac{1-x^{6i}}{1-x^i} \end{aligned}$$
