## Turning machine (圖靈機)

### What is turing machine?

Turing machine is defined by its transition functions, a.k.a **programs**. It can simulate the logic of algorithm or computation that can be described in terms of **step-by-step process**.

The Turing machine is a theoretical framework that introduces the concept of a **program**, in addition to the basic components of a computing machine, such as input/output machanisms, memory, and a processor.

### What is the function of *program* in Turing model?

The program in Turing model is a set of instructions that **tell the machine what to do**.

### What would happen if there were *no program* in the Turing model?

Without a program, the machine would be unable to interpret the input data, making the output data meaningless. Additionally, it is unclear how many types or sets of operations a machine based on this model can perform. Therefore, adding the program to the model is necessary to specify the operation of the machine.
